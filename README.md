# -Agriculture-Robot-
design and development of an Arduino-based (C++) Agriculture Robot aimed at automating small-scale farming operations through a combination of mechatronic systems, environmental sensing, and wireless control. The prototype robot integrates sensors for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity monitoring, coupled with a mobile robotic base.
